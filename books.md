## Reading List
I read a lot and am not against putting down a book if I realize it's a waste of time. Here, I'll link to my favorite books and articles in each category to hopefully give you an idea of what to read next. For some books, I create more detailed notes pages and those will be linked as applicable.

If you have any recommendations for me, I'd love to hear them!
