## Reading List
I read a lot and am not against putting down a book if I realize it's a waste of time. Here, I'll link to my favorite books and articles in each category to hopefully give you an idea of what to read next. 

If you have any recommendations for me, I'd love to hear them! 

- Reading list with hyperlinks to notes + ratings for each...should I also include journal articles here too? I think I will, at least for the international relations section
- each book will just be a cover and link to that page's review/notes/rating/extra info
