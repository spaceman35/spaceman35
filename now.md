## What I'm up to these days...

*last updated on Mar 15, 2025 from Seoul, South Korea*


I'm currently finishing up graduate school in Sogang University and trying to enjoy the spring weather and upcoming cherry blossom season to the fullest!

### Moving
- Preparing to move to Washington, DC this summer! I'm starting a new job at the Pentagon and I'm very excited to get back to a normal military job (as great as these last few years have been!!)

### Travels
- I recently got back from a trip to the Philippines and a trip to Singapore! The food was incredible in both places, but the sheer variety of delicious food in Singapore was life-changing.
