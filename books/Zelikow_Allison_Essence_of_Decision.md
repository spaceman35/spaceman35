### Part I: The Three Models of Decision-Making
- **Model I: Rational Actor Model (RAM)**
  - Assumes states act as unified rational decision-makers to maximize strategic objectives.
  - The Cuban Missile Crisis is seen as a calculated Soviet move to deter U.S. invasion of Cuba.
  - U.S. response was guided by cost-benefit analysis, seeking to avoid war while compelling missile removal.

- **Model II: Organizational Process Model**
  - Governments are not monolithic; actions result from standard operating procedures (SOPs) within bureaucracies.
  - Bureaucratic routines shaped crisis decisions (e.g., U.S. military response constrained by pre-set procedures).
  - Soviet missile deployment followed standard logistical processes, not a centralized strategic choice.

- **Model III: Bureaucratic Politics Model**
  - Policy outcomes result from bargaining among political actors with differing interests.
  - Kennedyâ€™s advisors had competing perspectives, leading to compromise policies.
  - Khrushchev faced internal pressures, influencing his decision to place and then remove missiles.

### Part II: Application to the Cuban Missile Crisis
- Each model provides a different explanation for Soviet and U.S. actions.
- The **Rational Actor Model** suggests deterrence and strategic maneuvering.
- The **Organizational Process Model** highlights constraints from bureaucratic inertia.
- The **Bureaucratic Politics Model** shows internal leadership struggles shaping decisions.
- No single model fully explains the crisis; a combination is necessary.

### Key Takeaways
- Decision-making in foreign policy is complex and shaped by multiple frameworks.
- Viewing events through different models helps avoid simplistic, one-dimensional explanations.
- Bureaucracies and internal politics can constrain leaders' choices, often leading to suboptimal outcomes.
- The Cuban Missile Crisis remains a critical case study for understanding government decision-making under pressure.
