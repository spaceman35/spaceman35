# Thinking, Fast and Slow

#### Review:

### Part I: Two Systems
- **System 1 (Fast Thinking)**: Intuitive, automatic, effortless, and emotional thinking.
- **System 2 (Slow Thinking)**: Deliberate, effortful, logical, and analytical thinking.
- We rely on System 1 for most decisions, but it is prone to biases and errors.
- System 2 can override System 1 but is lazy and often defers to it.

### Part II: Heuristics and Biases
- **Anchoring Effect**: We rely too much on the first piece of information encountered.
- **Availability Heuristic**: We judge the probability of events based on how easily examples come to mind.
- **Representativeness Heuristic**: We ignore statistical probability in favor of stereotypes.
- **Overconfidence Bias**: People overestimate their knowledge and predictive abilities.
- **Loss Aversion**: Losses loom larger than gainsâ€”people are more sensitive to losses than to equivalent gains.

### Part III: Overconfidence
- **The Illusion of Understanding**: We believe we understand past events better than we actually do.
- **The Illusion of Validity**: We overestimate our ability to make accurate predictions, especially in uncertain situations.
- **Planning Fallacy**: People underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions while overestimating benefits.
- **Hindsight Bias**: After an event occurs, people see it as having been predictable, though it was not.

### Part IV: Choices
- **Prospect Theory**: People evaluate potential losses and gains differently, often leading to irrational decisions.
- **Endowment Effect**: People value things they own more than things they do not.
- **Framing Effect**: How a choice is presented affects decision-making (e.g., 90% survival rate vs. 10% mortality rate).
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: People continue investments in failing projects due to past investments.

### Part V: Two Selves
- **Experiencing Self vs. Remembering Self**: The way we experience events differs from how we remember them.
- **Peak-End Rule**: Our memory of an experience is shaped by the peak moment and the end, rather than the total experience.
- **Duration Neglect**: The length of an experience has little impact on how we remember it.

### Key Takeaways
- Human thinking is riddled with biases, and intuition is often misleading.
- Rational decision-making is difficult; we default to heuristics and emotional reasoning.
- Understanding cognitive biases can help in making better choices in business, economics, and everyday life.
